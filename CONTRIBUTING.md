# Getting Involved 

Thank you for your interest in this project. We'd love to see your contributions. There are just few small guidelines you need to follow. 
Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project. 

## Opening an issue 
If you've noticed a bug or you have a suggestion for a new feature, please go ahead and open an issue in this project. Please do include as much information as possible.

Please file issues before doing substantial work; this will ensure that others don't duplicate the work and that there's a chance to discuss any design issues.

## Making a code change
We're always open to pull requests, but these should be small and clearly described so that we can understand what you're trying to do. 

When you're ready to start coding, fork the needed repository to your own GitHub account and make your changes in a new branch. Once you're happy, open a pull request and explain what the change is and why you think we should include it in our project. 

## Code reviews 
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests (PRs) for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for more information on using pull requests.
